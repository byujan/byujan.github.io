<p>Thank you for visiting my website! This blog will mainly delve into the idea and thoughts about anything and everything ranging from books to military lifestyle. Because this is a personal blog, my thoughts will not and do not represent the views of the military. This website is just a place for me to express my feelings at the time.</p>

<p>I am currently a young officer in the military who is a recent military academy graduate. My current hobbies include anything and everything in the fitness industry, trying new and exotic foods, and subjects related to technology. I would definitely not call myself an expert on any of these things, but I would like to believe I am somewhat at least a little bit knowledgable in these fields.</p>

<p class="mb-5">The goal of maintaining this blog website is to continue to learn about everything! Please follow me on my adventure of learning! </p>
